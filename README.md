Security auditing tool for web applications

> I'm using this project to learn Angular and having some fun with FE development, and I think that is not an oxymoron.

## Development deploy

You will need the following stuff in your machine:

- node >= 16.x
- Angular CLI >= 13
- GNU make

To start the application in development mode you can run `make dev`. The application will be opened in your browser, otherwise you can visit: http://localhost:31337/

> For more options, check the help, by running `make help`.
